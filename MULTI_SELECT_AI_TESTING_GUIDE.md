# Multi-Select AI Movement - Testing Guide

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Branch**: `feat/pr21-ai-selection-v2`  
**Bug Fixed**: AI not moving multiple selected shapes  

---

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
When you selected multiple shapes and asked the AI to move them, only ONE shape moved (the first selected shape).

### The Root Cause
The AI was **always providing a shapeId** parameter because:
1. Function schema descriptions said "the currently selected shape" (singular)
2. System prompt examples all showed `moveShape(shapeId, ...)` 
3. No examples showed omitting the shapeId for multi-select
4. The AI learned it MUST provide a shapeId from the examples

### The Solution
Updated 3 things:
1. ‚úÖ **Function schemas** (5 manipulation functions) - Now explicitly mention multi-select
2. ‚úÖ **System prompt** - Added new section #11: MULTI-SELECT OPERATIONS with clear examples
3. ‚úÖ **Examples** - Show omitting shapeId parameter for multi-select operations

---

## Files Modified

1. `/collabcanvas/src/services/aiFunctions.js`
   - Updated descriptions for: `moveShape`, `resizeShape`, `rotateShape`, `changeShapeColor`, `deleteShape`
   - All now say: "If shapeId is OMITTED, affects ALL currently selected shapes"

2. `/collabcanvas/src/services/ai.js`
   - Added guideline #11: MULTI-SELECT OPERATIONS
   - Updated movement examples to distinguish single vs multi-select
   - Added 5 clear multi-select examples

---

## Testing Checklist

### Setup
1. ‚úÖ Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. ‚úÖ Open http://localhost:5174
3. ‚úÖ Log in to your account
4. ‚úÖ Open AI chat panel (bottom-right corner)

---

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Multi-Select Move ‚≠ê PRIMARY TEST

**Steps:**
1. Create 5 shapes using AI: "create 5 random circles"
2. Manually select 3 of them (shift-click each one)
3. Tell AI: "move these up 100 pixels"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ ALL 3 selected shapes move up 100 pixels
- ‚úÖ AI confirms: "Moved 3 shape(s)"
- ‚úÖ Shapes stay selected after move
- ‚úÖ Console shows: `[AI] Parameters: { x: null, y: -100, relative: true }` (NO shapeId!)

**If this fails:**
- Check console for: `[AI] Parameters: { shapeId: "..." }`
- If you see a shapeId, the AI is still passing one (bug not fixed)

---

### Test 2: Multi-Select Move (Various Directions)

**Steps:**
1. Select 3-5 shapes
2. Test each direction:
   - "move them down 50"
   - "move them left 200"
   - "move them right 100"
   - "move them up 75"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All selected shapes move in the correct direction
- ‚úÖ Each command affects ALL selected shapes

---

### Test 3: Multi-Select Resize

**Steps:**
1. Create 4 rectangles: "create 4 rectangles"
2. Select all 4 (Cmd/Ctrl+A or shift-click each)
3. Tell AI: "resize these to 150x150"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All 4 rectangles resize to 150x150
- ‚úÖ AI confirms: "Resized 4 shape(s)"

---

### Test 4: Multi-Select Rotate

**Steps:**
1. Select 3+ shapes
2. Tell AI: "rotate them by 45 degrees"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All selected shapes rotate 45¬∞
- ‚úÖ Each shape rotates around its own center (not as a group)

---

### Test 5: Multi-Select Color Change

**Steps:**
1. Select 5+ shapes of different colors
2. Tell AI: "make them all red"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All 5+ shapes turn red (#FF0000 or similar)
- ‚úÖ AI confirms: "Changed color of 5 shape(s)"

---

### Test 6: Multi-Select Delete

**Steps:**
1. Create 10 shapes: "create 10 random shapes"
2. Select 3 of them
3. Tell AI: "delete these shapes"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Only the 3 selected shapes are deleted
- ‚úÖ The other 7 remain
- ‚úÖ AI confirms: "Deleted 3 shape(s)"

---

### Test 7: Single Shape Commands (Should Still Work)

**Steps:**
1. Create 5 shapes
2. Select only 1 shape
3. Tell AI: "move this up 50"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Only the selected shape moves
- ‚úÖ AI should still omit shapeId (selection has 1 shape)
- ‚úÖ Or AI can provide shapeId (both work)

---

### Test 8: Natural Language Variations

Test these phrases (select 3+ shapes first):

**Move Commands:**
- "move these shapes up 100"
- "move them down 50"
- "shift these to the right"
- "push them left"

**Color Commands:**
- "make these red"
- "change their color to blue"
- "paint them green"

**Rotate Commands:**
- "rotate these by 90 degrees"
- "spin them 45 degrees"

**Resize Commands:**
- "make these bigger"
- "resize them to 200x200"

**Delete Commands:**
- "delete these"
- "remove them"
- "get rid of these shapes"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All commands should affect ALL selected shapes
- ‚úÖ AI understands "these", "them", "their" = multi-select

---

### Test 9: Mixed Operations

**Steps:**
1. Create 10 shapes: "create 10 random circles"
2. Select 3 of them
3. Tell AI: "move them up 100, rotate by 45, and make them blue"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ AI performs multiple operations
- ‚úÖ All 3 shapes are moved, rotated, AND recolored
- ‚úÖ Might execute as separate function calls or ask for confirmation

---

### Test 10: Edge Cases

#### Test 10a: No Selection
**Steps:**
1. Deselect all (click empty canvas)
2. Tell AI: "move these up 100"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ AI responds with error: "Please select a shape first"
- ‚úÖ No shapes move

#### Test 10b: Single vs Plural Ambiguity
**Steps:**
1. Select 1 shape
2. Tell AI: "move this up 100"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Works correctly (1 shape moves)

#### Test 10c: Large Multi-Select (Stress Test)
**Steps:**
1. Create 50 shapes: "create 50 random circles"
2. Select all (Cmd/Ctrl+A)
3. Tell AI: "move them up 200"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ All 50 shapes move
- ‚úÖ Operation completes in < 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ Canvas maintains 60 FPS

## Console Debugging

### What to Look For

When you send a multi-select command, check the browser console for:

```javascript
[AI] Executing moveShape with params: {
  shapeId: undefined,    // ‚Üê Should be undefined or missing!
  x: null,
  y: -100,
  relative: true
}

[SelectionBridge] Selection updated: ["id1", "id2", "id3"]

[moveShape] Called with: {
  shapeId: undefined,    // ‚Üê Confirms no shapeId passed
  x: null,
  y: -100,
  relative: true
}

[moveShape] Current selection: {
  selectedShapeIds: ["id1", "id2", "id3"],    // ‚Üê Shows 3 shapes selected
  shapes: [...]
}
```

### Red Flags üö©

**If you see this, the bug is NOT fixed:**
```javascript
[AI] Executing moveShape with params: {
  shapeId: "some-id-here",    // ‚ùå Should be undefined!
  x: null,
  y: -100,
  relative: true
}
```

**This means the AI is still passing a shapeId and only one shape will move.**

---

## Expected Console Output (Success)

### For Multi-Select Move:
```
[AI] Sending message to OpenAI: move these up 100
[AI] Function call requested: moveShape { x: null, y: -100, relative: true }
[AI] Executing moveShape with params: { x: null, y: -100, relative: true }
[moveShape] Called with: { shapeId: undefined, x: null, y: -100, relative: true }
[moveShape] Current selection: { selectedShapeIds: [3 items], shapes: [3 items] }
[moveShape] Multi-select detected: 3 shapes
[moveShape] Moving shape 1/3...
[moveShape] Moving shape 2/3...
[moveShape] Moving shape 3/3...
[AI] moveShape result: { success: true, result: { movedCount: 3, ... } }
[AI] Getting follow-up response after function execution
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Only one shape moves"
**Cause:** AI is still passing a shapeId  
**Check:** Console logs for `shapeId: "..."`  
**Fix:** Verify the files were saved and dev server restarted

### Issue 2: "No shapes move"
**Cause:** Selection bridge not working  
**Check:** Console for `[SelectionBridge] Selection updated:`  
**Fix:** Make sure shapes are actually selected (blue highlight)

### Issue 3: "AI says 'I can't do that'"
**Cause:** API key or OpenAI connection issue  
**Check:** Browser console for API errors  
**Fix:** Check `.env.local` has valid `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Issue 4: "Shapes move wrong direction"
**Cause:** Coordinate system confusion  
**Note:** This is a different bug, not related to multi-select  
**Check:** Up should be negative Y, down positive Y

---

## Quick Test (1 Minute)

**Minimal test to confirm the fix works:**

1. Create 3 circles: "create 3 circles"
2. Select all 3 (Cmd/Ctrl+A)
3. Tell AI: "move up 100"
4. **Result:** All 3 circles should move up

If all 3 move ‚Üí ‚úÖ Bug is FIXED!  
If only 1 moves ‚Üí ‚ùå Bug still exists
