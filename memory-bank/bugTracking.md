# Bug Tracking System

## Overview
This document establishes our bug tracking methodology for the PR_PARTY documentation system. Every PR should include a comprehensive bug analysis section.

## Bug Documentation Template

### For Each PR, Include:

1. **High-Level Bug Summary**
   - Total bugs encountered
   - Critical vs minor bugs
   - Root cause categories
   - Time spent debugging

2. **Detailed Bug Analysis**
   - Bug #1: [Name] (Severity)
   - Bug #2: [Name] (Severity)
   - etc.

3. **For Each Bug, Document:**
   - **Discovery**: When/how was it found?
   - **Symptoms**: What did the user see?
   - **Root Cause**: Technical explanation
   - **Failed Attempts**: What didn't work and why
   - **Solution**: What finally worked
   - **Prevention**: How to avoid in future
   - **Files Modified**: Which files were changed
   - **Time to Fix**: How long it took

4. **Lessons Learned**
   - Key insights gained
   - Patterns to watch for
   - Debugging strategies that worked
   - Best practices discovered

## Bug Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Feature completely broken, blocks core functionality
- **HIGH**: Major functionality impaired, significant user impact
- **MEDIUM**: Minor functionality issues, workarounds available
- **LOW**: Cosmetic issues, edge cases

## Root Cause Categories

- **Data Flow**: Issues with data not reaching the right place
- **State Management**: React/Konva state synchronization
- **Event Handling**: Incorrect event propagation or handling
- **Architecture**: Wrong patterns or approaches
- **Configuration**: Missing or incorrect setup
- **Logic**: Algorithmic or business logic errors

## Benefits of This System

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Future developers can learn from our mistakes
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common bug types across PRs
3. **Debugging Efficiency**: Faster resolution of similar issues
4. **Quality Improvement**: Proactive prevention of known issues
5. **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive understanding of system behavior
