## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Decision Pending: AI Provider Choice
**Options:**
1. **OpenAI GPT-4** (recommended)
   - Pros: Mature function calling, good documentation, reliable
   - Cons: Requires API key, costs per request

2. **Anthropic Claude**
   - Pros: Also supports function calling, alternative option
   - Cons: Less tested, similar costs

**Recommendation**: Start with OpenAI GPT-4 (more established for function calling).

### Decision Pending: AI API Call Location
**Options:**
1. **Client-side** (faster to implement)
   - Pros: No backend needed, simpler
   - Cons: API key exposed, no rate limiting

2. **Backend proxy** (production-ready)
   - Pros: Secure, rate limiting, monitoring
   - Cons: More complex, need Cloud Functions or backend server

**Recommendation**: Client-side for MVP/demo, document security gap.

### Decision Made: Canvas API Pattern
**Decision**: Create unified Canvas API wrapper that both manual and AI operations use.

**Rationale:**
- Ensures consistency
- Single place for validation and error handling
- Easier to test
- Clean separation of concerns

**Impact**: All PRs from #18 onward will use this pattern.

### Decision Made: AI Integration Architecture
**Architecture:**
```
User Input
  → AI Service (OpenAI)
  → Function Call Parsed
  → Function Registry
  → Canvas API
  → Firestore
  → Real-time Sync to All Users
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear data flow
- AI and manual operations identical after Canvas API
- Real-time sync automatic
- Testable at each layer

## Current Blockers & Risks

### No Blockers Currently
MVP is complete and stable. Foundation is solid for next phase.

### Risks to Monitor

**Risk 1: Timeline Pressure**
- **Issue**: 5 days remaining, AI integration is complex
- **Mitigation**: Clear prioritization, focus on required features first
- **Status**: On track if we execute systematically

**Risk 2: AI API Reliability**
- **Issue**: AI responses could be slow or fail
- **Mitigation**: Good error handling, clear user feedback
- **Status**: Will address in PR #18-20

**Risk 3: Performance with AI Operations**
- **Issue**: Creating many shapes at once could slow down
- **Mitigation**: Batch operations, optimize Firestore writes
- **Status**: Will implement in PR #22-23

**Risk 4: AI Command Complexity**
- **Issue**: Natural language is ambiguous, AI might misunderstand
- **Mitigation**: Clear function schemas, good prompts, helpful errors
- **Status**: Will refine through testing in PR #24

## Testing Strategy Going Forward

### Continuous Testing (Every PR)
1. **Multi-window testing**: Always test with 2+ browsers
2. **Performance monitoring**: Check FPS stays at 60
3. **Sync verification**: Ensure all changes sync <100ms
4. **Error handling**: Test edge cases and errors

### AI-Specific Testing (PRs #18-24)
1. **Command testing**: Test each AI command individually
2. **Multi-user AI testing**: Two users use AI simultaneously
3. **Performance testing**: Measure response times
4. **Error testing**: Invalid commands, missing parameters, etc.
5. **Integration testing**: Mix manual and AI operations

### Pre-Submission Testing (PR #24)
1. **Full feature walkthrough**: Test all required features
2. **Demo video rehearsal**: Practice full demo
3. **Load testing**: Create 500+ shapes, 5+ concurrent users
4. **Cross-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
5. **Documentation review**: Ensure all docs accurate and complete

## Code Quality Guidelines

### For All New Code
- **Hooks**: Extract business logic into custom hooks
- **Services**: Keep Firebase operations in service layer
- **Components**: Keep components focused and simple
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive renders
- **Error handling**: Always return user-friendly error messages
- **Comments**: Document complex logic, especially AI-related

### AI-Specific Guidelines
- **Function schemas**: Clear descriptions and parameter docs
- **Validation**: Validate all parameters before execution
- **Error messages**: AI should understand what went wrong
- **Composability**: Simple functions that combine for complex operations
- **Idempotency**: Operations should be safe to retry

## Communication & Documentation

### What to Document
- **Every AI function**: Description, parameters, examples
- **Every complex operation**: How it works, why this approach
- **Every performance optimization**: What it does, impact
- **Every known issue**: What it is, workaround if any

### AI Development Log (Due at End)
Track these throughout development:
1. **Tools used**: Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.
2. **Effective prompts**: What worked well
3. **AI-generated vs hand-written**: Rough percentages
4. **Strengths**: Where AI helped most
5. **Limitations**: Where AI struggled
6. **Key learnings**: Insights about AI-assisted development

- ✅ Deployed and accessible

**Status**: ~40% complete. MVP done, core features in progress, AI phase not started.

**Critical Path**: Must complete AI integration (PRs #18-24) - this is the key differentiator.

## Notes for Next Session

### When Resuming Work
1. Read through all memory bank files (especially this one)
2. Review revisedTask.md for detailed PR breakdown
3. Check progress.md for what's done vs what's left
4. Start with PR #11: Line Shape Support
5. Work through PRs sequentially - each builds on previous
6. Keep AI integration in mind - design for programmability

### Quick Context Recovery
- **What we built**: Real-time collaborative canvas with shapes and cursors
- **What works**: MVP features all working and deployed
- **What's next**: Complete shape types, then AI integration
- **What's critical**: AI agent - this is what makes project unique
- **Timeline**: ~5 days remaining, need to move quickly

### Key Reminders
- AI agent is the differentiator - prioritize it
- Test with multiple browsers constantly
- Maintain 60 FPS - profile frequently
- Document as you go, especially AI functions
- Keep Canvas API design clean and simple
- Every operation should be AI-callable
