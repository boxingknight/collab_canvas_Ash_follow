# PR_PARTY 🎉

Welcome to the PR Party! This directory contains comprehensive documentation for every Pull Request in the CollabCanvas project.

## Purpose

Each PR gets a detailed implementation plan document **before** code is written. This ensures:
- 🎯 Clear architecture decisions
- 📋 Complete requirements understanding
- ✅ Well-defined success criteria
- 🧪 Comprehensive testing strategy
- 🚀 Smooth implementation
- 📚 Historical reference

## File Naming Convention

```
PRXX_FEATURE_NAME.md
```

**Examples**:
- `PR11_LINE_SHAPES.md`
- `PR12_TEXT_SHAPES.md`
- `PR18_AI_SERVICE.md`
- `PR20_AI_BASIC_COMMANDS.md`

## Document Structure

Each PR document follows this template:

### 1. Overview
- Goal and why it matters
- Key features
- Estimated time and risk level

### 2. Architecture & Design Decisions
- Coordinate systems
- Data structures
- Component relationships
- Key technical decisions and rationale

### 3. Cross-Platform Considerations
- Desktop support (browsers)
- Mobile/tablet support
- Browser-specific issues
- Performance considerations

### 4. Locking Mechanism Integration
- How it integrates with existing locking
- Visual feedback
- Edge case handling

### 5. Future-Proofing
- Extensibility plans
- AI integration readiness
- Compatibility with future PRs

### 6. Implementation Details
- Files to modify
- Code changes (with examples)
- Line-by-line breakdown

### 7. Testing Strategy
- Manual test checklist
- Automated test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-browser testing matrix

### 8. Rollout Plan
- Phase-by-phase implementation
- Git workflow
- Deployment steps

### 9. Success Criteria
- Must have (required)
- Nice to have (optional)
- Out of scope (explicitly not included)

### 10. Risk Assessment
- Technical risks
- Project risks
- Mitigation strategies

## How to Use

### Before Starting a PR
1. Read the relevant PR document
2. Understand all architecture decisions
3. Review the testing strategy
4. Confirm success criteria

### During Implementation
1. Follow the rollout plan
2. Check off tasks as you complete them
3. Update the document if you deviate from the plan
4. Document any issues or learnings

### After Completing a PR
1. Mark all checklist items as complete
2. Update with actual time taken
3. Note any deviations from the plan
4. Document lessons learned

## Contributing

When creating a new PR document:

1. Copy the template from an existing PR (e.g., `PR11_LINE_SHAPES.md`)
2. Update all sections with relevant information
3. Be thorough - more detail is better than less
4. Include code examples where helpful
5. Define clear success criteria
6. Identify all risks and mitigations
7. Create a realistic rollout plan

## Best Practices

### Architecture Decisions
- **Document the "why"** not just the "what"
- Consider alternatives and explain why rejected
- Think about future implications
- Balance simplicity with extensibility

### Cross-Platform
- Always consider mobile/tablet
- Test on all major browsers
- Think about touch events
- Consider accessibility

### Testing
- Define clear test cases
- Include performance benchmarks
- Plan for multi-user scenarios
- Consider edge cases

### Risk Management
- Identify technical risks early
- Plan mitigation strategies
- Assess project impact
- Be realistic about probability

## Questions?

If you're unsure about:
- **What to document**: Start with architecture decisions and success criteria
- **How much detail**: More is better - assume reader knows nothing
- **When to create**: Before writing any code
- **How to structure**: Follow existing PR documents as templates
