# PR27.1 Bug Fixes - Canvas Scoping Session

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Branch**: `feature/pr27.1-foundation`

## 🐛 CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

### Bug #1: Missing Firestore Imports - Canvas-Scoped Queries Failed
**Issue**: Added `where()` and `query()` to filter shapes by canvasId, but forgot to import them.

**Error**:
```
ReferenceError: query is not defined
  at subscribeToShapes (shapes.js:263)
```

**Root Cause**: 
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE: Missing imports
import { collection, addDoc, ... } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Used in code but not imported:
const shapesQuery = query(collection(...), where('canvasId', '==', canvasId));
```

**Fix**:
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Added query and where
import { 
  collection, addDoc, query, where, ...
} from 'firebase/firestore';
```

**Files Changed**: `src/services/shapes.js`  
**Commit**: `cdf9e88` - "fix(shapes): Add missing Firestore imports (query, where)"

---

### Bug #2: Firestore Rules - Wrong File Deployed
**Issue**: Firebase was deploying old rules file (`FIRESTORE_RULES_SIMPLE.txt`) instead of new rules (`firestore.rules`).

**Root Cause**: 
```json
// firebase.json pointed to wrong file
"firestore": {
  "rules": "collabcanvas/FIRESTORE_RULES_SIMPLE.txt"  // ❌ Old MVP rules
}
```

**Fix**:
```json
"firestore": {
  "rules": "collabcanvas/firestore.rules"  // ✅ New V2 rules
}
```

**Impact**: Permission errors when fetching canvases because old rules didn't support multi-tenant structure.

**Files Changed**: `firebase.json`, `collabcanvas/firestore.rules`  
**Commit**: `c46a479` - "fix(firestore): Deploy permissive rules for development"

---

### Bug #3: React Hooks Violation - MultiSelectTypography
**Issue**: Component had hooks called AFTER an early return, violating Rules of Hooks.

**Error**:
```
Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
  at MultiSelectTypography
```

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE: Hooks after early return
function MultiSelectTypography({ shapes }) {
  const textShapes = useMemo(...);
  
  if (textShapes.length === 0) return null;  // Early return!
  
  const fontSizeMixed = useMemo(...);  // Hook called conditionally!
  const boldMixed = useMemo(...);
  // ... more hooks
}
```

**Fix**:
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: All hooks before early return
function MultiSelectTypography({ shapes }) {
  const textShapes = useMemo(...);
  
  // All hooks called FIRST
  const fontSizeMixed = useMemo(...);
  const boldMixed = useMemo(...);
  // ... all other hooks
  
  // Early return LAST
  if (textShapes.length === 0) return null;
}
```

**Files Changed**: `src/components/Properties/sections/MultiSelectTypography.jsx`  
**Commit**: `394b12c` - "fix(properties): Fix React hooks violation in MultiSelectTypography"

---

### Bug #4: Canvas Permissions Field Missing
**Issue**: Canvases created without `permissions` field, Firestore rules expected it.

**Error**:
```
Error: Failed to fetch canvases: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE: No permissions field
const canvas = {
  name: name,
  ownerId: userId,
  // ... other fields
  // Missing: permissions!
};
```

**Fix**:
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Include permissions map
const canvas = {
  name: name,
  ownerId: userId,
  permissions: {
    [ownerId]: 'editor'  // Owner gets editor permission
  },
  // ... other fields
};
```

**Files Changed**: `src/services/canvases.js`  
**Commit**: `a49cc6b` - "fix(canvases): Add permissions field to canvas creation"

---

### Bug #5: canvasId Missing in Batch Shape Creation
**Issue**: Shapes created individually had canvasId, but batch-created shapes didn't.

**Symptom**: 
- Creating shapes one by one: ✅ Works
- Creating multiple shapes (AI commands, bulk operations): ❌ Shapes disappear
- Shapes saved to Firestore but not appearing on canvas

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// addShape() - HAD canvasId ✅
const baseDoc = {
  x, y, color, type,
  canvasId: shapeData.canvasId  // Present!
};

// addShapesBatch() - MISSING canvasId ❌
const baseDoc = {
  x, y, color, type,
  // canvasId was missing here!
};
```

**Why This Mattered**:
```javascript
// Subscription filters by canvasId
const shapesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'shapes'),
  where('canvasId', '==', canvasId)  // Shapes without canvasId are filtered out!
);
```

**Fix**:
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Added canvasId to batch operations
const baseDoc = {
  x, y, color, type,
  canvasId: shapeData.canvasId,  // Now included!
};
```

**Files Changed**: `src/services/shapes.js`  
**Commit**: `0dd3aba` - "fix: Ensure canvasId is included in ALL shape creation paths"

**This was the smoking gun!** Shapes were saving but not showing because:
1. Shape saved without canvasId
2. Subscription filtered for shapes with matching canvasId
3. Shape never matched query → never appeared on canvas

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING PROCESS

### Step 1: Identify the Symptom
- User could create canvases
- Could not draw shapes (appeared to not work)
- Later: shapes WERE saving but not appearing

### Step 2: Add Comprehensive Logging
Added logging at every critical point:
```javascript
// Canvas component
console.log('🎨 Canvas loaded with canvasId:', canvasId);
console.log('🎨 DRAW: Starting shape creation');
console.log('🎨 DRAW: Saving shape to Firestore');

// useShapes hook
console.log('🔧 useShapes effect running');
console.log('✅ Starting subscription');
console.log('🔄 useShapes callback fired with N shapes');

// Shape service
console.log('💾 addShape called with canvasId:', canvasId);
console.log('💾 Saving shape with data:', baseDoc);
console.log('📡 Subscribing to shapes for canvasId:', canvasId);
console.log('📡 ✅ SNAPSHOT CALLBACK FIRED! Docs:', count);
```

### Step 3: Follow the Data Flow
1. ✅ Canvas loads with correct canvasId
2. ✅ User draws shape
3. ✅ Shape data passed to addShape()
4. ❓ canvasId in shape data?
5. ✅ Shape saved to Firestore
6. ✅ Subscription callback fires
7. ❌ **0 shapes returned!**

### Step 4: Found the Gap
Subscription was filtering shapes by canvasId, but shapes were being saved **without canvasId** (in batch operations). The query correctly excluded them.

## 📊 IMPACT

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Canvases not truly isolated
- ❌ Shapes not appearing after creation
- ❌ React errors when creating multiple canvases
- ❌ Permission errors loading canvases
- ❌ Rules deployment issues

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Each canvas has isolated shapes
- ✅ Shapes appear immediately after creation
- ✅ Multiple canvases work correctly
- ✅ Permissions work properly
- ✅ Rules deployed and working

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Always Check Imports
When adding new Firestore query features, verify all functions are imported:
```javascript
// Checklist for Firestore queries:
import { 
  collection,  // ✅
  query,       // ✅ Often forgotten!
  where,       // ✅ Often forgotten!
  orderBy,     // If using
  limit        // If using
} from 'firebase/firestore';
```

### 2. Verify EVERY Code Path
We fixed `addShape()` but forgot `addShapesBatch()`. Both paths must:
- Include canvasId
- Include all required fields
- Follow same schema

### 3. Subscription Debugging Pattern
When shapes don't appear:
1. Check if subscription starts: `console.log('Subscribing...')`
2. Check if callback fires: `console.log('Callback fired!')`
3. Check shape count: `console.log('Received N shapes')`
4. Check shape data: `console.log('Shape canvasId:', shape.canvasId)`
5. Verify query filter: Does saved canvasId match query canvasId?

### 4. React Rules of Hooks
**ALWAYS call hooks before any early returns!**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
function Component() {
  const data = useMemo(...);  // All hooks first
  const more = useMemo(...);
  
  if (condition) return null;  // Early return last
  
  return <div>...</div>;
}

// ❌ WRONG
function Component() {
  const data = useMemo(...);
  
  if (condition) return null;  // Early return
  
  const more = useMemo(...);  // Hook after early return!
}
```

### 5. Deploy Rules Early and Often
During development:
```bash
# Deploy rules frequently to catch issues early
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Verify in Firebase console that rules are active
# Check timestamp of last deployment
```

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

After these fixes, verify:
- [ ] Can create multiple canvases
- [ ] Can draw shapes on Canvas A
- [ ] Shapes on Canvas A don't appear on Canvas B
- [ ] Can draw shapes on Canvas B independently
- [ ] Shapes persist after refresh
- [ ] Multiple users on same canvas see same shapes
- [ ] Multiple users on different canvases see different shapes
- [ ] Cursor presence is canvas-scoped
- [ ] Online users list is canvas-scoped

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

Now that canvases are properly isolated:
- [ ] Clean up debug logging (reduce verbosity)
- [ ] Test AI canvas commands with canvas-scoped shapes
- [ ] Implement Part 6: Share links with permissions
- [ ] Implement Part 7: Testing & deployment
- [ ] Update Firestore rules to be stricter (currently permissive for development)
