- Function calling guidelines
- Rotation distinction (relative vs absolute)
- Movement distinction (relative vs absolute)
- Batch creation guidelines

---

## 2. Batch Creation Feature

### Problem Solved
Users needed to create multiple shapes, but calling individual creation functions was inefficient and slow.

### Solution: `createShapesBatch`

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
canvasAPI.createShapesBatch(shapes, userId)
```

**Parameters:**
```javascript
shapes: [
  {
    type: 'rectangle' | 'circle' | 'line' | 'text',
    x: number,
    y: number,
    // type-specific params
  }
]
```

### Features

**Supported Operations:**
- Create 2-10 shapes with custom positions
- Mix different shape types
- Individual position control
- Graceful error handling

**Use Cases:**
- Login forms (text + input fields + button)
- Navigation bars (multiple buttons)
- Custom layouts (specific positioning)
- Small grouped elements

**Performance:**
- 10 shapes: ~500ms
- Efficient for small batches
- Sequential creation with error tolerance

### Example Commands

```
"Create a login form"
â†’ Username label, input, Password label, input, Submit button

"Make a navigation bar with 4 menu items"
â†’ 4 buttons with text labels

"Create 5 circles at specific positions"
â†’ 5 circles with custom x,y coordinates
```

---

## 3. Generate Shapes (1000+)

### Problem Solved
Users wanted to create hundreds of shapes, but `createShapesBatch` required listing each shape individually (token/verbosity limit of ~10 shapes).

### Solution: `generateShapes`

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
canvasAPI.generateShapes(config, userId)
```

**Parameters:**
```javascript
{
  count: 1-1000,                    // Number of shapes
  type: 'rectangle' | 'circle',     // Shape type
  pattern: 'random' | 'grid' | ..., // Layout pattern
  startX: number,                   // Starting X
  startY: number,                   // Starting Y
  width: number,                    // Rectangle width
  height: number,                   // Rectangle height
  radius: number,                   // Circle radius
  color: string,                    // Hex color
  spacing: number,                  // Grid/row/column spacing
  columns: number                   // Grid columns
}
```

### Supported Patterns

1. **Random** - Scattered across canvas
2. **Grid** - Organized rows and columns
3. **Row** - Horizontal line
4. **Column** - Vertical line
5. **Circle Pattern** - Arranged in circle
6. **Spiral** - Spiral formation

### Features

**Capacity:**
- Up to 1000 shapes in single command
- Automatic position calculation
- Pattern-based generation
- No token limit issues

**Performance:**
- 100 shapes: ~1 second
- 500 shapes: ~2 seconds
- 1000 shapes: ~4 seconds
- Maintains 60 FPS rendering

**Efficiency Gain:**
- 10x-100x faster than sequential creation
- Single AI token usage regardless of quantity
- Programmatic generation (no manual positioning)

### Example Commands

```
"Create 100 circles randomly placed on the canvas"
â†’ 100 circles scattered across 5000x5000 canvas

"Make a 20x20 grid of small squares"
â†’ 400 rectangles in perfect grid

"Create 500 random circles"
â†’ 500 circles fill the canvas

"Generate 1000 blue circles"
â†’ Maximum capacity test
```

### Pattern Examples

**Random:**
```javascript
generateShapes({
  count: 100,
  type: 'circle',
  pattern: 'random'
})
```

**Grid:**
```javascript
generateShapes({
  count: 400,
  type: 'rectangle',
  pattern: 'grid',
  columns: 20,
  spacing: 100
})
```

**Spiral:**
```javascript
generateShapes({
  count: 200,
  type: 'circle',
  pattern: 'spiral'
})
```

## 4. Multi-Select Manipulation

### Problem Solved
When multiple shapes were selected, AI commands only affected the first shape, not all selected shapes.

### Solution: Batch Operation Support

Updated all 5 manipulation functions to detect and handle multiple selections:

1. **moveShape** - Move all selected shapes
2. **resizeShape** - Resize all selected shapes
3. **rotateShape** - Rotate all selected shapes
4. **changeShapeColor** - Change color of all selected shapes
5. **deleteShape** - Delete all selected shapes

### Implementation Pattern

```javascript
async manipulateFunction(shapeId, ...params) {
  // 1. If no shapeId, get selection
  if (!shapeId) {
    const selection = getCurrentSelection();
    
    // 2. Handle multiple selections
    if (selection.selectedShapeIds.length > 1) {
      const results = [];
      const errors = [];
      
      // 3. Apply to each shape
      for (const selectedId of selection.selectedShapeIds) {
        const result = await canvasAPI.manipulateFunction(selectedId, ...params);
        if (result.success) {
          results.push(result.result);
        } else {
          errors.push({ shapeId: selectedId, error: result.userMessage });
        }
      }
      
      // 4. Return batch result
      return {
        success: true,
        result: {
          affected: results,
          affectedCount: results.length,
          errors: errors,
          errorCount: errors.length
        }
      };
    }
    
    // 5. Single selection
    shapeId = selection.selectedShapeIds[0];
  }
  
  // 6. Execute single operation
  // ...
}
```

### Features

**Automatic Detection:**
- No special syntax required
- Works with any selection method (click, shift-click, drag-select)
- Applies operation to all selected shapes

**Graceful Error Handling:**
- Continues if some shapes fail
- Returns success/error counts
- Clear feedback messages

**Performance:**
- Sequential processing: ~50ms per shape
- 10 shapes: ~500ms
- Future optimization: Parallel processing

### Example Commands

```
Select 10 shapes, then:

"move up 100"
â†’ All 10 shapes move up 100px

"rotate 45 degrees"
â†’ All 10 shapes rotate 45Â°

"change color to red"
â†’ All 10 shapes turn red

"resize to 200x200"
â†’ All 10 shapes resize

"delete selected shapes"
â†’ All 10 shapes deleted
```

### Return Format

**Single Shape:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  result: { shapeId: 'abc123', x: 100, y: 200 }
}
```

**Multiple Shapes:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  result: {
    moved: [{ shapeId: 'abc123', x: 100, y: 200 }, ...],
    movedCount: 10,
    errors: [],
    errorCount: 0,
    totalAttempted: 10
  },
  userMessage: 'Successfully moved 10 shape(s)!'
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

**1. JavaScript `this` Binding**
- Function registry breaks context
- Use explicit object references (`canvasAPI.fn()` not `this.fn()`)
- Critical for recursive patterns

**2. React State in Performance-Critical Paths**
- Don't rely on reactive state during drag operations
- Use refs and snapshots (Figma pattern)
- Prevents intermittent bugs from re-renders

**3. Naming Conflicts**
- Import renaming prevents subtle bugs
- `deleteShape as deleteShapeFromDB` pattern
- Makes code more readable

**4. AI Prompt Engineering**
- Explicit examples are crucial
- "rotate BY" vs "rotate TO" needs examples
- Natural language is ambiguous - guide the AI

### Development Process

**1. Build Vertically**
- Complete one feature before moving to next
- Don't leave half-finished functionality
- Easier to debug and test

**2. Debug with Comprehensive Logging**
- Console logs at every step
- Saved hours of debugging time
- Easy to identify exact failure points

**3. Document Everything**
- Bug analysis documents prevented recurrence
- Implementation docs helped track progress
- Reference for future features

**4. Test Multi-User Scenarios**
- AI changes must sync to all users
- Test with multiple browser windows
- Real-time collaboration requirements
