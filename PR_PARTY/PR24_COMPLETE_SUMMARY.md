### 2. `collabcanvas/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx`
**Major Changes**:
- Imported useClipboard and useHistory hooks
- Created canvasAPI object for history operations
- Added 6 new handler functions:
  - `handleCopy()`

## 🎨 USER EXPERIENCE

### Copy/Paste Workflow
```
User: Creates a blue rectangle
User: Selects rectangle
User: Presses Cmd+C
Console: "Copied 1 shape"

User: Presses Cmd+V
→ New rectangle appears 20px offset

User: Presses Cmd+V again
→ Another rectangle appears 40px offset

User: Presses Cmd+V again
→ Another rectangle appears 60px offset
```

### Undo/Redo Workflow
```
User: Creates rectangle
User: Creates circle
User: Creates text

User: Presses Cmd+Z
→ Text disappears
Console: "Undo successful"

User: Presses Cmd+Z
→ Circle disappears

User: Presses Cmd+Shift+Z
→ Circle reappears
Console: "Redo successful"

User: Presses Cmd+Shift+Z
→ Text reappears
```

### Combined Workflow
```
User: Creates shape
User: Selects shape
User: Presses Cmd+C (copy)
User: Presses Cmd+V (paste) → New shape appears
User: Presses Cmd+Z (undo) → Pasted shape disappears
User: Presses Cmd+Shift+Z (redo) → Pasted shape reappears
```
