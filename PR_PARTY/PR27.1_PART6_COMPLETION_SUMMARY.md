**3. ShareLinkAccess Page** (`src/pages/ShareLinkAccess/ShareLinkAccess.jsx`)
- ✅ Handles `/share/:linkId` route
- ✅ Validates share link
- ✅ Checks authentication (redirects to login if needed)
- ✅ Grants permissions automatically

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Firestore Rules Blocking Share Link Operations ✅

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Users couldn't delete their own share links

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
match /shareLinks/{token} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if isAuthenticated() 
    && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
}
```
Generic `write` rule only worked for CREATE operations. DELETE checks `resource.data` (existing document), not `request.resource.data` (new document).

**Solution**:
```javascript
// AFTER (Fixed):
match /shareLinks/{linkId} {
  allow read: if true;
  
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() 
    && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
  
  allow update: if isAuthenticated();
  
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated() 
    && resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
}
```

**Result**: Delete functionality now works perfectly ✓

---

### Bug #2: Auth Loading State Not Checked (Redirect Loop) ✅

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Logged-in users redirected to dashboard instead of gaining canvas access

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const { user } = useAuth();

if (!user) {
  // ❌ Triggers immediately while auth is still loading!
  navigate('/login?returnUrl=...');
}
```

`useAuth()` initially returns `{ user: null, loading: true }`. Component checked `if (!user)` before auth finished loading, causing immediate redirect even for logged-in users.

**Solution**:
```javascript
// AFTER (Fixed):
const { user, loading } = useAuth();

if (loading) {
  return; // ✅ Wait for auth to finish loading
}

if (!user) {
  // ✅ Now knows user is ACTUALLY not logged in
  navigate('/login?returnUrl=...');
}
```

**Result**: Share links work perfectly for both logged-in and logged-out users ✓

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Dashboard Layout Polish

**Issue**: "+New Canvas" button was not horizontally centered when displayed alone.

**Solution**: Smart CSS centering using `:has()` pseudo-class
```css
.dashboard-main-header {
  justify-content: center; /* Default: center button */
}

.dashboard-main-header:has(.view-title) {
  justify-content: space-between; /* When title exists: space apart */
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Empty state: Button centered perfectly
- ✅ With canvases: Title left, button right
- ✅ No JavaScript needed - pure CSS!

### Button Text Consistency

**Changed**: 
- Before: `<svg icon> New Canvas`
- After: `+New Canvas`

**Result**: Simpler, cleaner look with better centering

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Check Loading States
When working with async auth providers (Firebase, Auth0), **ALWAYS** check the `loading` state before making decisions based on user authentication.

**Pattern to follow**:
```javascript
const { user, loading } = useAuth();

if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (!user) return <Login />;
return <AuthenticatedContent />;
```

### 2. Firestore Rules: Be Specific
Don't use generic `write` rules. Always split into:
- `create` - for new documents (check `request.resource.data`)
- `update` - for modifying documents (check `request.resource.data`)
- `delete` - for removing documents (check `resource.data`)

### 3. Modern CSS is Powerful
The `:has()` pseudo-class enabled smart centering without JavaScript. Modern CSS features can solve complex layout problems elegantly.

### 4. Comprehensive Logging Saves Time
The 6-step logging system made debugging infinitely easier. Investing 30 minutes in logging saved hours of debugging time.

### 5. Reusable Components Win
Using the same ShareDialog in both canvas and dashboard:
- Reduced code duplication
- Ensured consistent UX
- Made testing easier
- Simplified maintenance
