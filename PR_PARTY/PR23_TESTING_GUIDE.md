# PR #23: Complex Operations - Comprehensive Testing Guide

**Status**: Pre-Implementation  
**Purpose**: Define testing strategy, test cases, and acceptance criteria for complex operations  
**Estimated Testing Time**: 1-2 hours

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Layered Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests** (Manual) - Test each function individually
2. **Integration Tests** - Test AI calling the functions
3. **Visual Tests** - Verify layout and appearance
4. **Multiplayer Tests** - Verify real-time sync
5. **Edge Case Tests** - Verify boundary conditions
6. **Performance Tests** - Verify speed and efficiency

## 📝 Testing Notes

### Testing Tips

1. **Test incrementally** - Test each function as you implement it
2. **Test manually first** - Faster iteration than automated tests
3. **Test with AI second** - Verify natural language interpretation
4. **Test edge cases third** - Verify robustness
5. **Test multiplayer last** - Most complex test scenario

### Common Issues to Watch For

- Text appearing behind rectangles (z-index)
- Inconsistent spacing between operations
- Canvas boundary overflows
- Multiplayer sync delays
- AI parameter extraction failures
- Partial creation on errors

### Debugging Tools

- Browser DevTools (Inspect elements, measure positions)
- Console logs (Track function calls, parameters)
- Firebase Console (Verify shape data)
- Network tab (Check sync latency)
- Performance tab (Measure FPS, creation time)
