## Bug #1: Selection Clearing After Marquee Release

**Severity**: 🔴 HIGH  
**Category**: Event Timing  
**Discovery**: Manual testing after initial implementation  
**Time to Debug**: ~10 minutes  
**Fix Complexity**: Simple (flag + timeout)  

---

### Symptoms

When a user completed a marquee selection:
1. Click and drag on empty canvas → blue selection box appears ✅
2. Shapes inside the box highlight during drag ✅
3. Release mouse → shapes deselect immediately ❌

**Expected**: Selected shapes should remain selected after release  
**Actual**: Selection cleared instantly, making marquee useless

---

### Root Cause

**Event Sequence Conflict:**

```javascript
// Browser fires events in this order:
mouseDown   → marqueeStartRef set
mouseMove   → shapes selected
mouseUp     → marquee finalized
click       → 🔥 PROBLEM! Stage click fires after mouseUp
```

The `handleStageClick` event handler was designed to clear selection when clicking empty canvas:

```javascript
function handleStageClick(e) {
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    clearSelection(); // ❌ Fires after marquee mouseUp!
  }
}
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Browser always fires `click` after `mouseUp` (standard behavior)
- Konva propagates both events to stage
- `clearSelection()` fires ~20ms after marquee completes
- User sees selection flash and disappear

---

### Failed Attempts

**None!** This was immediately recognized as a classic event timing issue.

Similar pattern seen in Bug #4 of PR #13 (click-after-drag conflicts), so the solution was known.

---

### Solution

**Approach**: Flag-based guard with short timeout

```javascript
// Flag to track when marquee just finished
const justFinishedMarqueeRef = useRef(false);

function handleMouseUp(e) {
  if (isMarqueeActive) {
    // Marquee is complete - finalize selection
    setIsMarqueeActive(false);
    marqueeStartRef.current = null;
    marqueeCurrentRef.current = null;
    
    // Set flag to prevent stage click from clearing
    justFinishedMarqueeRef.current = true;
    
    // Reset flag after click event fires (~20-50ms delay)
    setTimeout(() => {
      justFinishedMarqueeRef.current = false;
    }, 50);
  }
}

function handleStageClick(e) {
  // Skip if we just finished a marquee selection
  if (justFinishedMarqueeRef.current) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Normal click - clear selection
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    clearSelection();
  }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
1. `mouseUp` sets flag immediately (synchronous)
2. `click` fires ~20ms later, sees flag, returns early
3. `setTimeout` clears flag after click window passes
4. Next stage click works normally (flag is false)

---

### Testing

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Complete marquee → shapes stay selected
- ✅ Click empty canvas after marquee → selection clears
- ✅ Rapid marquee operations → no race conditions
- ✅ Marquee + shift-click → selection persists

**Edge Cases:**
- ✅ Very fast marquee (click+release <100ms) → still works
- ✅ Escape during marquee → flag not set (correct)
- ✅ Multiple marquees in succession → no stuck flag

---

### Commit

```bash
git commit -m "fix: preserve marquee selection after mouse release

PROBLEM:
- Stage click event fires after mouseUp
- clearSelection() was being called after marquee completed
- Selection flashed and disappeared immediately

SOLUTION:
- Added justFinishedMarqueeRef flag
- Set to true in mouseUp, resets after 50ms
- handleStageClick checks flag and skips clear

RESULT:
✅ Marquee selection persists after release
✅ Normal stage clicks still clear selection
✅ No race conditions or stuck states
"
```

---

### Lessons Learned

1. **Event Timing is Tricky**: Browser event order (`mouseUp` → `click`) can cause conflicts
2. **Flag-based Guards Work**: Simple boolean ref with timeout is reliable
3. **Timing Window**: 50ms is safe window for click after mouseUp
4. **Reuse Patterns**: Similar to PR #13 Bug #4 (click-after-drag)
5. **Test Event Sequences**: Always test complete user interaction flows

## Bug #2: Marquee Activates in Pan Mode

**Severity**: 🔴 HIGH  
**Category**: Mode Conflict  
**Discovery**: User testing  
**Time to Debug**: ~5 minutes  
**Fix Complexity**: Trivial (logic fix)  

---

### Symptoms

When a user was in Pan mode (V key):
1. Press V → mode switches to 'pan' ✅
2. Click and drag on canvas → blue selection box appears ❌
3. Canvas doesn't pan, marquee activates instead ❌

**Expected**: Pan mode should pan the canvas, not activate marquee  
**Actual**: Marquee activated in pan mode, preventing panning

---

### Root Cause

**Logic Error in Mode Check:**

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Too permissive
function handleMouseDown(e) {
  const isClickingStage = e.target === e.target.getStage();
  
  // This activates marquee in BOTH pan AND move modes!
  if (isClickingStage && (mode === 'pan' || mode === 'move')) {
    marqueeStartRef.current = { x: pos.x, y: pos.y };
    setIsMarqueeActive(true);
    return;
  }
}
```

**Why This Was Wrong:**
- Logic says "activate marquee if pan OR move"
- Should have been "activate marquee ONLY in move"
- Simple boolean logic error in initial implementation

---

### Failed Attempts

**None!** Obvious logic error caught in code review.

---

### Solution

**Approach**: Strict mode check (move mode only)

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Only in move mode
function handleMouseDown(e) {
  const isClickingStage = e.target === e.target.getStage();
  
  // Marquee ONLY works in move mode
  if (isClickingStage && mode === 'move' && !isDrawing) {
    marqueeStartRef.current = { x: pos.x, y: pos.y };
    marqueeCurrentRef.current = { x: pos.x, y: pos.y };
    setIsMarqueeActive(true);
    e.target.stopDrag(); // Also prevent stage panning
    return;
  }
  
  // In other modes, normal behavior
}
```

**Additional Safeguard:**
```javascript
// In handleMouseMove - double-check mode
function handleMouseMove(e) {
  if (isMarqueeActive && mode === 'move') {
    // Update marquee...
  }
}
```

**Mode Behavior Matrix:**

| Mode | Empty Canvas Drag | Marquee Active? | Stage Panning? |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Pan (V)** | Pan canvas | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Move (M)** | Select shapes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Draw (D)** | Draw shape | ❌ No | ❌ No |

---

### Testing

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Pan mode (V) → drag pans canvas, no marquee
- ✅ Move mode (M) → drag creates marquee, no panning
- ✅ Draw mode (D) → drag creates shape, no marquee
- ✅ Switch modes mid-canvas → correct behavior
- ✅ Escape cancels marquee → panning works again

**Edge Cases:**
- ✅ Start marquee in move mode → switch to pan mid-drag → marquee cancels
- ✅ Rapid mode switching → no stuck states
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts during marquee → mode switches, marquee cancels

---

### Commit

```bash
git commit -m "fix: restrict marquee selection to move mode only

PROBLEM:
- Marquee was activating in both pan and move modes
- Users couldn't pan canvas - marquee would activate instead
- Mode separation was broken

SOLUTION:
- Changed condition to: mode === 'move' only
- Added stopDrag() to prevent stage panning in move mode
- Added mode check in handleMouseMove as safeguard

RESULT:
✅ Pan mode (V) - pans canvas, no marquee
✅ Move mode (M) - activates marquee, no panning
✅ Draw mode (D) - draws shapes, no marquee
✅ Clear mode separation maintained
"
```

---

### Lessons Learned

1. **Mode Awareness is Critical**: Features must respect mode system
2. **Test Each Mode**: Always test all modes (pan/move/draw)
3. **Clear Requirements**: "Move mode only" should have been explicit in design
4. **Follows Figma Pattern**: Figma's V/M/D modes work exactly this way
5. **Simple Bugs Happen**: Even trivial logic errors need testing

---

## Prevention Strategies

### For Future PRs

**1. Event Timing Checklist**
```
Before implementing event-driven features:
□ Document complete event sequence (mouseDown → mouseMove → mouseUp → click)
□ Identify potential timing conflicts
□ Plan guard flags for event order issues
□ Test rapid interactions (<100ms sequences)
```

**2. Mode Testing Matrix**
```
For any canvas interaction:
□ Test in Pan mode (V)
□ Test in Move mode (M)
□ Test in Draw mode (D)
□ Test mode switching mid-interaction
□ Verify only intended modes activate feature
```

**3. Selection State Testing**
```
For any selection-related feature:
□ Test selection persistence after interaction
□ Test click events after mouse interactions
□ Test rapid selection changes
□ Test with existing selection vs empty selection
```

## Pattern Library

### Pattern 1: Flag-Based Event Guards

**Problem**: Event A should prevent Event B from firing immediately after  
**Solution**: Flag + timeout pattern

```javascript
const justDidActionRef = useRef(false);

function handleActionComplete() {
  justDidActionRef.current = true;
  setTimeout(() => {
    justDidActionRef.current = false;
  }, 50); // Timing window for next event
}

function handleNextEvent() {
  if (justDidActionRef.current) return; // Guard
  // ... normal behavior
}
```

**Used In:**
- Bug #1 (marquee selection persistence)
- PR #13 Bug #4 (click after drag)

**When to Use:**
- Mouse event sequences (mouseUp → click)
- Drag operations followed by clicks
- Any async event that might conflict

---

### Pattern 2: Mode-Aware Feature Activation

**Problem**: Feature should only work in specific modes  
**Solution**: Strict mode checking with early returns

```javascript
function handleInteraction(e) {
  // Check mode first - most specific to least specific
  if (mode === 'specific_mode' && otherConditions) {
    activateFeature();
    return;
  }
  
  // Fall through to default behavior
  handleDefaultBehavior();
}
```

**Used In:**
- Bug #2 (marquee mode restriction)
- All shape drawing logic
- Pan vs move interactions

**When to Use:**
- Any feature tied to V/M/D modes
- Mutually exclusive interactions
- Canvas interaction handlers
