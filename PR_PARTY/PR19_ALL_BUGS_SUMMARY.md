## Bug #1: Rectangle Drag Position Snap

### Problem
Rectangles snapped to a different position after being dragged, even though circles worked correctly.

**User Report:**
> "looks like the movement of my rectangles has broken. after moving the shape it snaps to a different position than its end position. something is not being saved correctly in firebase."

### Symptoms
- Drag rectangle from position A to B
- Release mouse
- Rectangle snaps to position C (different from A and B)
- Circles worked correctly
- Issue appeared after rotation feature was added

### Root Cause

**The Coordinate System Mismatch**

When we added rotation support, we changed rectangles and text to rotate around their visual center by using `offsetX` and `offsetY`:

```javascript
// In Shape.jsx - for rotation
<Rect
  x={shape.x + shape.width / 2}  // Position at center
  y={shape.y + shape.height / 2}
  offsetX={shape.width / 2}      // Shift visual back to top-left
  offsetY={shape.height / 2}
  // ... other props
/>
```

This made Konva treat the rectangle's `x,y` as its **center** (for rotation), but we were still saving positions as if they were **top-left** (for consistency with Firebase).

**The Problem:**
- `handleDragEnd` only converted circles from center to top-left
- Rectangles were saving their center position as if it were top-left
- This caused the snap after drag

### The Fix

Extended the center-to-top-left conversion logic to include rectangles and text:

**In `Shape.jsx`:**

```javascript
// Before - only circles converted
const isCircle = shapeType === SHAPE_TYPES.CIRCLE;
if (isCircle) {
  finalX = e.target.x() - radius;
  finalY = e.target.y() - radius;
}

// After - rectangles and text too
const isRect = shapeType === SHAPE_TYPES.RECTANGLE;
const isText = shapeType === SHAPE_TYPES.TEXT;
const isCircle = shapeType === SHAPE_TYPES.CIRCLE;

if (isCircle) {
  finalX = e.target.x() - radius;
  finalY = e.target.y() - radius;
} else if (isRect || isText) {
  finalX = e.target.x() - width / 2;
  finalY = e.target.y() - height / 2;
}
```

**Also fixed:**
- `isRect` definition: was `SHAPE_TYPES.RECT` → corrected to `SHAPE_TYPES.RECTANGLE`
- Applied same conversion in `handleTransform` (resize/rotate)

### Prevention

Added a **COORDINATE SYSTEM REFERENCE** comment block in `Canvas.jsx` documenting:
- How positions are stored (top-left)
- How they're rendered in Konva (center for circles/rectangles/text)
- Conversion rules for all shape types

---

## Bug #2: Multi-Select Drag Post-Rotation

### Problem
After implementing rotation support, multi-select drag broke. When dragging multiple selected shapes, some would snap to incorrect positions or not move at all.

**User Report:**
> "looks like we are now seeing a similar bug as we were before when moving multiple objects. when multiple objects are picked up, one or more snap to a different location when being carried."

### Symptoms
- Select 5 rectangles
- Start dragging
- 1-2 shapes snap to different locations mid-drag
- Sometimes shapes jump to correct position when dropped
- Intermittent - didn't happen every time

### Root Cause

The multi-select drag logic in `handleShapeDragStart` was positioning Konva nodes incorrectly after the rotation feature added center-based positioning.

**The Issue:**
```javascript
// In handleShapeDragStart - BEFORE
if (shapeInitial.type === 'circle') {
  node.position({
    x: shape.x + shape.radius,
    y: shape.y + shape.radius
  });
} else {
  // Rectangles and text - treated as top-left
  node.position({ x: shape.x, y: shape.y });  // ❌ WRONG!
}
```

But rectangles and text now use center-based positioning (after rotation feature), so they needed the same treatment as circles.

### The Fix

Updated `handleShapeDragStart` to position rectangles and text at their center:

```javascript
// In handleShapeDragStart - AFTER
if (shapeInitial.type === 'circle') {
  node.position({
    x: shape.x + shape.radius,
    y: shape.y + shape.radius
  });
} else if (shapeInitial.type === 'rectangle' || shapeInitial.type === 'text') {
  // Rectangles and text also use center-based positioning now
  node.position({
    x: shape.x + shape.width / 2,
    y: shape.y + shape.height / 2
  });
}
```

Also updated `handleShapeDragMove` with the same logic for real-time position updates during drag.

### Testing
- ✅ Select 5 rectangles → drag → all move smoothly
- ✅ Select 10 mixed shapes → drag → no snapping
- ✅ Rotation still works correctly

## Bug #3: Multi-Select Drag Interruption

### Problem
During multi-select drag, the selection would sometimes clear mid-drag, causing shapes to stop moving.

**User Report:**
> "sometimes one of the multiple objects will not be moved at all."

### Symptoms
- Select 5 shapes
- Start dragging
- Mid-drag, selection clears (shapes lose highlight)
- Shapes stop following cursor
- Have to drop and re-select

### Root Cause

**Selection Clearing During Drag**

The `handleStageClick` function was clearing selection whenever a click event fired, even during drag operations:

```javascript
// In handleStageClick - BEFORE
const handleStageClick = (e) => {
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    setSelectedShapeIds([]);  // ❌ Clears selection even during drag!
  }
};
```

During drag, if any click-like event fired (mousedown, touch event), it would trigger `handleStageClick` and clear the selection, breaking the multi-select drag.

### The Fix

Added drag state check to prevent selection changes during drag:

**In `Canvas.jsx`:**

```javascript
// Added guard to handleStageClick
const handleStageClick = (e) => {
  if (isDraggingShape) return;  // ✅ Don't clear during drag
  
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    setSelectedShapeIds([]);
  }
};

// Also added to handleShapeSelect
const handleShapeSelect = (id, e) => {
  if (isDraggingShape) return;  // ✅ Don't change selection during drag
  
  // ... rest of selection logic
};
```

This locks the selection during any drag operation, matching Figma's behavior.

### Prevention
- Always check `isDraggingShape` before modifying selection
- Lock all selection-modifying functions during drag
- Prevents race conditions between drag and selection updates

---

## Bug #4: Reactive State During Drag

### Problem
Even after fixing Bug #3, multi-select drag was still intermittently buggy. Shapes would occasionally stop moving mid-drag or snap to wrong positions.

**User Report:**
> "looks like we still see the same issue. only occurs once in a while. this could be the speed that firebase updates the shape position."

### Symptoms
- Intermittent (not every time)
- More likely with many shapes
- More likely during long drags
- Hard to reproduce consistently

### Root Cause

**The Reactive State Problem**

The multi-select drag logic was relying on **reactive React state** (`isMultiSelect`, `selectedShapeIds`) during the drag operation:

```javascript
// In handleShapeDragMove - BEFORE
if (activeDragRef.current === 'multi-select' && isMultiSelect) {  // ❌ Depends on reactive state
  selectedShapeIds.forEach(shapeId => {  // ❌ Uses reactive array
    // Update positions...
  });
}
```

**Why This Failed:**

When Firebase updates a shape, React re-renders. During this re-render:
- `isMultiSelect` might momentarily be `false` (if selection state is being reconciled)
- `selectedShapeIds` might change or be empty
- The multi-select drag logic sees these stale values and fails
- The drag breaks mid-operation

**This is a Classic React Pitfall:**
Don't rely on reactive state for performance-critical operations that span multiple frames!

### The Fix: Figma's "Snapshot at Drag Start" Pattern

**The Solution:**
Capture selection state at the **beginning** of the drag and use only refs (which don't change) during the drag:

```javascript
// In handleShapeDragStart
initialPositionsRef.current = {};
selectedShapeIds.forEach(shapeId => {
  // Capture snapshot of each shape
  initialPositionsRef.current[shapeId] = {
    x: shape.x,
    y: shape.y,
    type: shape.type,
    // ... other props
  };
});
```

Then during drag, **never use reactive state**:

```javascript
// In handleShapeDragMove - AFTER
if (activeDragRef.current === 'multi-select') {  // ✅ Only check ref
  // Iterate over snapshot, not reactive state
  Object.keys(initialPositionsRef.current).forEach(shapeId => {  // ✅ Uses ref
    const shapeInitial = initialPositionsRef.current[shapeId];
    // Update using captured snapshot...
  });
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Removed `&& isMultiSelect` from conditions
2. Changed `selectedShapeIds.forEach()` to `Object.keys(initialPositionsRef.current).forEach()`
3. All drag operations now use only refs and captured snapshots
4. Zero reliance on reactive state during drag

### Why This Works

**Refs vs State:**
- **Refs**: Stable references that don't change during re-renders
- **State**: Can change during re-renders, causing stale reads

**The Pattern:**
1. **At drag start**: Capture complete snapshot in ref
2. **During drag**: Use only the snapshot (never read state)
3. **At drag end**: Update state and Firebase

This is exactly how Figma handles drag operations - snapshot at start, refs during drag, state update at end.

### Prevention
- Never use reactive state in `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks
- Never use reactive state in performance-critical loops
- Always use refs for values needed across multiple frames
- Capture snapshots at operation start for multi-frame operations

## Bug #5: Rotate & Delete Not Working

### Problem
After implementing multi-select support, rotation didn't work for groups, and delete didn't work at all (neither single nor multi-select).

**User Report:**
> "looks like we successfully got 3/5 correct. rotating does not work as a group. and delete does not work for both alone and a group."

### Symptoms
- Move: ✅ Works
- Resize: ✅ Works
- Color: ✅ Works
- Rotate: ❌ Single works, multi-select fails
- Delete: ❌ Doesn't work at all

### Root Cause #1: Delete Function Naming Conflict

**The Issue:**
```javascript
// Import named 'deleteShape'
import { deleteShape } from './shapes';

// Method also named 'deleteShape'
export const canvasAPI = {
  async deleteShape(shapeId) {
    // When we call deleteShape() here, which one?
    await deleteShape(shapeId);  // ❌ AMBIGUOUS!
  }
}
```

JavaScript couldn't tell which `deleteShape` to call - the imported function or the method being defined.

**The Fix:**
```javascript
// Rename import to avoid conflict
import { deleteShape as deleteShapeFromDB } from './shapes';

// Method name stays clear
export const canvasAPI = {
  async deleteShape(shapeId) {
    await deleteShapeFromDB(shapeId);  // ✅ CLEAR!
  }
}
```

### Root Cause #2: Unknown (Required Debugging)

For rotate, the issue wasn't immediately clear. Added comprehensive debug logging to trace execution.

### Prevention
- Always rename imports when there's potential for naming conflicts
- Use descriptive import aliases (`as deleteShapeFromDB`)
- Add debug logging to trace complex flows

---

## Bug #6: JavaScript `this` Binding

### Problem
Even after fixing the naming conflict, delete still didn't work. This was the **final boss** bug.

**User Report:**
> "ok now 4/5. delete still doesnt work for 1 shape or multiple. dive deeper to find the root cause of this issue"

### Symptoms
- With debug logging, we could see the function being called
- But the recursive call `this.deleteShape()` was failing silently
- Same pattern that should work for other functions

### Root Cause

**JavaScript `this` Context Loss**

When functions are called through an object registry, they lose their original `this` context:

```javascript
// How AI calls functions
const functionRegistry = {
  'deleteShape': canvasAPI.deleteShape  // ❌ Extracts function, loses context
};

// Later...
result = await functionRegistry['deleteShape'](params);
// ^ Inside function, `this` is undefined!
```

**Inside the function:**
```javascript
async deleteShape(shapeId) {
  for (const id of selectedIds) {
    await this.deleteShape(id);  // ❌ `this` is undefined!
  }
}
```

**Why Some Functions "Worked":**

They were actually **failing silently** for multi-select! The single-shape path worked because it didn't use recursion. We only noticed the bug when we tested multi-select thoroughly.

### The Fix

Changed **ALL** recursive calls from `this.functionName()` to `canvasAPI.functionName()`:

```javascript
// BEFORE - All functions
async deleteShape(shapeId) {
  for (const id of selectedIds) {
    await this.deleteShape(id);  // ❌ `this` undefined
  }
}

// AFTER - All functions
async deleteShape(shapeId) {
  for (const id of selectedIds) {
    await canvasAPI.deleteShape(id);  // ✅ Explicit reference
  }
}
```

**Fixed in ALL 5 functions:**
1. ✅ `moveShape` - `this.moveShape()` → `canvasAPI.moveShape()`
2. ✅ `resizeShape` - `this.resizeShape()` → `canvasAPI.resizeShape()`
3. ✅ `rotateShape` - `this.rotateShape()` → `canvasAPI.rotateShape()`
4. ✅ `changeShapeColor` - `this.changeShapeColor()` → `canvasAPI.changeShapeColor()`
5. ✅ `deleteShape` - `this.deleteShape()` → `canvasAPI.deleteShape()`

### Why This Happens

**JavaScript `this` Rules:**

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
};

obj.greet();           // "Hello, I'm Alice" ✅
const fn = obj.greet;
fn();                  // "Hello, I'm undefined" ❌
```

`this` is determined by **HOW** the function is called, not **WHERE** it's defined!

### Alternative Solutions (Not Used)

**Option 1: Function Binding**
```javascript
export const functionRegistry = {
  'deleteShape': canvasAPI.deleteShape.bind(canvasAPI)
};
```
✅ Works, but requires updating aiFunctions.js for every function.

**Option 2: Call with Context**
```javascript
result = await functionRegistry[functionName].call(canvasAPI, params);
```
✅ Works, but makes call site more complex.

**Option 3: Explicit Reference (CHOSEN)**
```javascript
await canvasAPI.deleteShape(id);  // Explicit reference
```
✅ **Best**: Simple, clear, self-documenting, no magic.

### Prevention
- Never use `this` in objects called through registries
- Always use explicit object references (`obj.method()`)
- Consider arrow functions (but they have their own issues)
- Document the pattern for future functions

## Summary of Root Causes

### 1. **Coordinate System Mismatches** (Bugs #1, #2)
- **Issue**: Mixing top-left and center-based positioning
- **Solution**: Consistent conversions at save/load boundaries
- **Pattern**: Document coordinate systems clearly

### 2. **Event Timing Issues** (Bug #3)
- **Issue**: Selection clearing during drag operations
- **Solution**: Guard selection changes with drag state
- **Pattern**: Lock UI during critical operations

### 3. **Reactive State in Performance Paths** (Bug #4)
- **Issue**: Using React state during multi-frame operations
- **Solution**: Snapshot at operation start, use refs during operation
- **Pattern**: Figma's "snapshot at drag start" approach

### 4. **Naming Conflicts** (Bug #5)
- **Issue**: Import and method have same name
- **Solution**: Rename imports with descriptive aliases
- **Pattern**: Always use `as aliasName` for clarity

### 5. **JavaScript Context Binding** (Bug #6)
- **Issue**: `this` context lost in function registries
- **Solution**: Explicit object references instead of `this`
- **Pattern**: `obj.method()` not `this.method()`

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Code Patterns to Follow

**1. Coordinate Conversions**
```javascript
// ALWAYS convert at boundaries
// Save: Konva center → Firebase top-left
// Load: Firebase top-left → Konva center
```

**2. Selection Locking**
```javascript
function handleAnything() {
  if (isDraggingShape) return;  // Guard ALL selection changes
  // ... selection logic
}
```

**3. Snapshot for Multi-Frame Operations**
```javascript
function startOperation() {
  snapshotRef.current = getCurrentState();  // Capture now
  // During operation: use snapshotRef only
  // At end: update state
}
```

**4. Import Aliasing**
```javascript
import { deleteShape as deleteShapeFromDB } from './service';
// Now no ambiguity
```

**5. Explicit Object References**
```javascript
// ✅ DO THIS
await canvasAPI.someMethod();

// ❌ NOT THIS
await this.someMethod();
```
