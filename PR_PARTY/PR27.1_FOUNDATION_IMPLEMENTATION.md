# PR #27.1: Foundation Implementation 🏗️

**Branch**: `feature/pr27.1-foundation`  
**Status**: 🚀 IN PROGRESS  
**Goal**: Multi-tenant canvas management (commercial foundation)  
**Time Estimate**: 40-50 hours  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Everything builds on this

## 🎯 Mission

Transform CollabCanvas from single-canvas demo to multi-tenant platform where:
- Each user has their own workspace
- Users can create unlimited canvases
- Canvases can be shared with permissions
- Data is completely isolated per user
- Professional landing page + dashboard experience

**This is the foundation for a commercial product.**

## ✅ Success Criteria

By the end of PR27.1, users should be able to:

1. ✅ Visit landing page and understand what CollabCanvas is
2. ✅ Sign up with email verification
3. ✅ See a dashboard with all their canvases (grid view)
4. ✅ Create new canvases (unlimited)
5. ✅ Open any canvas in the editor
6. ✅ Edit canvas (all existing features work)
7. ✅ Share canvas via link (with view/edit permissions)
8. ✅ Access shared canvas (if they have permission)
9. ✅ Delete canvases (soft delete to trash)
10. ✅ Have their data completely isolated from other users

## 🏗️ PART 1: Data Architecture (CURRENT)

**Goal**: Design and implement new Firestore structure for multi-tenancy

**Time**: 8-10 hours

---

### Step 1.1: Create New Firestore Schema Document

**File**: `collabcanvas/FIRESTORE_SCHEMA_V2.md`

This documents the complete new data model.

---

### Step 1.2: Update Firestore Security Rules

**File**: `collabcanvas/firestore.rules`

New rules to support workspaces, canvases, and permissions.

---

### Step 1.3: Create Service Files

**New Files**:
- `collabcanvas/src/services/workspaces.js`
- `collabcanvas/src/services/canvases.js`

**Updated Files**:
- `collabcanvas/src/services/shapes.js` (add canvasId filtering)

---

### Step 1.4: Write Migration Script

**File**: `collabcanvas/scripts/migrate-to-v2.js`

Migrates existing data from single-canvas to multi-canvas structure.

**CRITICAL**: Must be tested thoroughly before running on production!
