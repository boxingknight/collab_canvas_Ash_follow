## üéØ What We're Building

### 5 New AI Selection Commands

1. **selectShapesByType**(type)
   - Select all shapes of a specific type
   - Types: 'rectangle', 'circle', 'line', 'text'
   - Example: "Select all circles"

2. **selectShapesByColor**(color)
   - Select all shapes with matching color
   - Hex color code (e.g., '#FF0000')
   - Example: "Select all red shapes"

3. **selectShapesInRegion**(x, y, width, height)
   - Select shapes within rectangular region
   - Uses AABB intersection (any overlap)
   - Example: "Select shapes in the top-left quadrant"

4. **selectShapes**(shapeIds)
   - Select specific shapes by their IDs
   - Array of shape IDs
   - Example: Programmatic selection for chaining

5. **deselectAll**()
   - Clear all selections
   - No parameters
   - Example: "Clear selection"

---

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Functions (1 hour)
1. Add helper functions to `canvasAPI.js`:
   - `getShapeBounds(shape)` - Get bounding box for any shape type
   - `isShapeInRegion(shape, x, y, w, h)` - AABB intersection check
   - `validateShapeType(type)` - Validate type parameter

2. Implement 5 selection functions in `canvasAPI.js`:
   - Each function: ~30 lines
   - Uses existing `getAllShapes()` from shapes service
   - Filters shapes based on criteria
   - Calls `selectionBridge.updateSelection(shapeIds)`
   - Returns formatted result with count and message

### Phase 2: AI Integration (30 minutes)
1. Add 5 function schemas to `aiFunctions.js`
2. Update function registry
3. Update system prompt in `ai.js` with selection commands

### Phase 3: Testing (30 minutes)
1. Manual testing of each command
2. Test chaining (select ‚Üí manipulate)
3. Multi-user testing
4. Natural language testing

### Phase 4: Documentation (15 minutes)
1. Update README with selection commands
2. Update memory bank (mark complete)
3. Document any learnings

## üîó Integration Points

### Existing Systems (No Changes Needed!)
- ‚úÖ **Selection Bridge** (`selectionBridge.js`) - Already has `updateSelection()`
- ‚úÖ **useSelection Hook** - Already provides selection state management
- ‚úÖ **Canvas Component** - Selection UI already works
- ‚úÖ **Shape Components** - Visual feedback already implemented

### What This Enables
- ‚úÖ AI can now **target specific shapes** programmatically
- ‚úÖ Users can chain **select ‚Üí manipulate** operations
- ‚úÖ Natural language like "Select all X and do Y"
- ‚úÖ Complex workflows become possible

---

## üìä Expected Impact

### User Value
- **More powerful AI**: Can target subsets intelligently
- **Natural commands**: "Select all circles" is intuitive
- **Complex workflows**: Chain multiple operations
- **Efficiency**: Batch operations without manual selection

### Technical Value
- **Clean integration**: Uses existing patterns
- **No new infrastructure**: Leverages selection bridge
- **Chainable**: Combines with existing 12 commands
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more selection types later

### Grade Impact
- **Current**: 103/110 (93.6%)
- **After PR #21**: Same (selection enhances existing AI capability)
- **Real value**: Makes AI significantly more powerful

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

**Total: 2-3 hours**

Breakdown:
- Helper functions: 30 minutes
- 5 selection functions: 1 hour (12 min each)
- AI integration: 30 minutes
- Testing: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 15 minutes
- Buffer: 15 minutes

---

## üéì Key Principles

### 1. Follow Existing Patterns
- Use same structure as PR #18 functions
- Use same validation approach
- Use same return format
- Use same error handling

### 2. Keep It Simple
- Just filter and select, no complex logic
- Leverage existing `getAllShapes()`
- Use existing `selectionBridge`
- No new state management needed

### 3. Test Thoroughly
- Test each function individually
- Test chaining with existing commands
- Test multi-user scenarios
- Test natural language understanding

### 4. Document Everything
- Clear JSDoc comments
- Update README
- Update memory bank
- Document any decisions

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Read** `/PR_PARTY/PR21_SELECTION_COMMANDS.md` thoroughly
2. **Create branch**: `git checkout -b feat/ai-selection-commands`
