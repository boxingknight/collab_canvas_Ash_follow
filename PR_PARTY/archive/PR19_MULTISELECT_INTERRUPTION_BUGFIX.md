# PR #19 - Multi-Select Drag Interruption Bug Fix

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Category**: Event Handling / Selection Management  
**Impact**: Multi-Select Functionality

## Problem

When dragging multiple selected shapes, **the multi-select drag would randomly stop mid-drag**, leaving only the originally clicked shape moving while others froze in place.

### User Report
> "when dragging multiple objects sometimes they will start moving together and halfway through the move only the single object being held will continue moving and all the other ones stop moving."

### Symptoms
1. ‚úÖ Multi-select drag starts correctly (all shapes move together)
2. ‚ùå Mid-drag: Other shapes stop moving suddenly
3. ‚ùå Only the directly clicked/held shape continues moving
4. ‚ùå Unpredictable - happens sometimes, not always
5. ‚ùå More common with fast drag motions
6. ‚ùå Selection appears to be cleared mid-drag

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Selection-Clearing Click Event

The `handleStageClick` function is designed to clear selection when clicking empty canvas space:

```javascript
// Current code (BEFORE fix):
function handleStageClick(e) {
  // Don't clear selection if we just finished a marquee
  if (justFinishedMarqueeRef.current) return;
  
  // ‚ùå NO guard against clearing during drag!
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    clearSelection(); // Clears selection mid-drag!
  }
}
```

**The Problem**: If a `click` event fires during a drag operation, this function will clear the selection, breaking the multi-select drag!

### Why Click Events Fire During Drag

Several scenarios can cause `click` events to fire while dragging:

1. **Fast Click/Drag Motion**
   - User clicks and immediately drags
   - Browser may register both click and drag events
   - Click event fires slightly after drag start

2. **Multi-Touch Events**
   - User accidentally touches screen with second finger
   - Mouse button accidentally clicks during touchpad drag
   - Multiple input devices active

3. **Event Ordering Issues**
   - Browser event order: `mousedown` ‚Üí `mouseup` ‚Üí `click`
   - If drag motion is very short, `click` still fires
   - Konva propagates events to stage

4. **Konva Stage Events**
   - Stage has its own click listener
   - Even during drag, stage can receive click events
   - No built-in guard against this

### The Cascading Effect

```
Timeline of Bug:

T=0ms    User clicks shape in multi-select
         ‚îî‚îÄ> handleShapeDragStart fires
             ‚îî‚îÄ> setIsDraggingShape(true)
             ‚îî‚îÄ> activeDragRef.current = 'multi-select'
             ‚îî‚îÄ> All shapes start moving together ‚úÖ

T=50ms   User moves mouse (dragging)
         ‚îî‚îÄ> handleShapeDragMove fires repeatedly
             ‚îî‚îÄ> All shapes move in sync ‚úÖ

T=100ms  Click event fires on stage (from fast motion)
         ‚îî‚îÄ> handleStageClick fires
             ‚îî‚îÄ> clearSelection() called
             ‚îî‚îÄ> selectedShapeIds becomes []
             ‚îî‚îÄ> isMultiSelect becomes false ‚ùå

T=110ms  handleShapeDragMove fires again
         ‚îî‚îÄ> Checks: activeDragRef.current === 'multi-select' && isMultiSelect
             ‚îî‚îÄ> isMultiSelect is now FALSE! ‚ùå
             ‚îî‚îÄ> Multi-select logic doesn't run
             ‚îî‚îÄ> Only directly dragged shape moves ‚ùå

T=200ms  User continues dragging
         ‚îî‚îÄ> Only one shape moves (others frozen) ‚ùå
```

### Why This Is Intermittent

The bug only occurs when:
- ‚úÖ Click event fires during active drag
- ‚úÖ Fast drag motion (more likely to trigger click)
- ‚úÖ Certain mouse/touchpad behaviors
- ‚úÖ Multi-touch scenarios

It doesn't occur every time because:
- ‚ùå Slow drags don't trigger click events
- ‚ùå Some input devices behave differently
- ‚ùå Event ordering varies by browser

## How Figma Handles This

### Research: Professional Design Tools

**Figma's Approach:**
1. **Selection Lock During Drag**: Selection is frozen/locked during any drag operation
2. **No Selection Changes Allowed**: All selection-modifying operations are blocked
3. **Event Guards**: Click events, keyboard shortcuts, and other selection changes are prevented
4. **Drag Completion Required**: Selection can only change after drag completes

**Miro's Approach:**
- Similar to Figma
- Drag state takes priority over selection changes
- Explicit drag cancellation (Escape) required to unlock selection

**Industry Pattern:**
> **"Selection is immutable during drag operations"**

All professional canvas/design tools follow this pattern:
- Adobe XD
- Sketch
- Framer
- Excalidraw
- tldraw

## Solution Comparison

### Solution 1: Guard Stage Click ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED (IMPLEMENTED)

**Approach**: Add `isDraggingShape` check to prevent clearing selection during drag.

```javascript
function handleStageClick(e) {
  if (justFinishedMarqueeRef.current) return;
  
  // ‚úÖ Prevent clearing selection during drag
  if (isDraggingShape) return;
  
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    clearSelection();
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Simple, one-line fix
- ‚úÖ Uses existing state
- ‚úÖ Matches Figma behavior
- ‚úÖ No performance impact
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand
- ‚úÖ Minimal code change

**Cons**:
- None

**Why This Works**:
- `isDraggingShape` is set to `true` at drag start
- Remains `true` throughout drag
- Set to `false` only at drag end
- React state ensures consistent value across renders

---

### Solution 2: Guard All Selection Changes

**Approach**: Add guards to ALL functions that modify selection.

```javascript
function handleShapeSelect(shapeId, event) {
  if (isDraggingShape) return; // ‚úÖ Guard
  // ... normal selection logic
}

function handleStageClick(e) {
  if (isDraggingShape) return; // ‚úÖ Guard
  // ... clear selection
}

function handleSelectAll() {
  if (isDraggingShape) return; // ‚úÖ Guard
  // ... select all
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive protection
- ‚úÖ Prevents ALL selection changes during drag
- ‚úÖ Very defensive

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå More code changes
- ‚ùå Must guard every selection function

**Implementation**: Also implemented this for extra safety!

---

### Solution 3: Event Propagation Prevention

**Approach**: Stop click events from reaching stage during drag.

```javascript
function handleShapeDragStart(shapeId) {
  setIsDraggingShape(true);
  
  // Disable stage listening during drag
  const stage = stageRef.current;
  if (stage) {
    stage.listening(false);
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Prevents events at source

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Too aggressive (disables ALL stage interactions)
- ‚ùå Can affect other features
- ‚ùå Hard to debug
- ‚ùå Not recommended

---

### Solution 4: Time-Based Guard

**Approach**: Use a flag with timeout (like marquee fix).

```javascript
const justFinishedDragRef = useRef(false);

function handleShapeDragEnd(data) {
  setIsDraggingShape(false);
  justFinishedDragRef.current = true;
  setTimeout(() => {
    justFinishedDragRef.current = false;
  }, 50);
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Handles edge cases with event timing

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå More complex than Solution 1
- ‚ùå Timing window is arbitrary
- ‚ùå Not as clean
- ‚ùå Doesn't solve mid-drag issue (only post-drag)

---

## Implementation

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Guard to `handleStageClick`

```javascript
function handleStageClick(e) {
  // Don't clear selection if we just finished a marquee selection
  if (justFinishedMarqueeRef.current) {
    return;
  }
  
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Don't clear selection during any drag operation
  // This prevents selection from being cleared mid-drag if a click event fires
  // (Matches Figma behavior: selection is locked during drag)
  if (isDraggingShape) {
    return;
  }
  
  if (e.target === e.target.getStage()) {
    clearSelection();
  }
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- `isDraggingShape` is `true` from drag start to drag end
- Prevents stage clicks from clearing selection during this window
- After drag ends, stage clicks work normally again

#### 2. Added Guard to `handleShapeSelect`

```javascript
function handleShapeSelect(shapeId, event) {
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Don't allow selection changes during drag
  // (Matches Figma behavior: selection is locked during drag)
  if (isDraggingShape) {
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of selection logic
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- Prevents clicking other shapes during a drag
- Even if click events fire, selection won't change
- Comprehensive protection

## Prevention Strategy

### Why This Bug Occurred

1. **Incomplete Event Guards**: Stage click handler lacked drag guard
2. **Event Timing Not Considered**: Click events during drag were overlooked
3. **Testing Gap**: Fast drag motions not tested in initial multi-select PR
4. **Pattern Not Applied**: Marquee had similar guard, but pattern not generalized

### How to Prevent in Future

#### 1. Selection Change Checklist ‚úÖ

**When implementing ANY feature that modifies selection:**

```
‚ñ° Guard against changes during marquee selection
‚ñ° Guard against changes during shape drag
‚ñ° Guard against changes during text editing
‚ñ° Guard against changes during draw mode
‚ñ° Test with fast user interactions
‚ñ° Test with multi-touch scenarios
```

#### 2. State-Based Guards Pattern

**For all user interaction handlers:**

```javascript
function handleUserInteraction(e) {
  // Check ALL active states that should block this interaction
  if (isMarqueeActive) return;
  if (isDraggingShape) return;
  if (isDrawing) return;
  if (isEditingText) return;
  
  // Proceed with interaction
}
```

**Pattern to Remember**:
> **"Always check what the user is CURRENTLY doing before changing state"**

#### 3. Event Timing Testing

**Test these scenarios for ALL features:**

```
‚ñ° Click and immediately drag (< 50ms)
‚ñ° Drag and immediately click (< 50ms)
‚ñ° Rapid alternating click/drag
‚ñ° Multi-touch during operation
‚ñ° Keyboard shortcuts during operation
‚ñ° Mode switching during operation
```

#### 4. Industry Research

**Before implementing interaction features:**

```
1. Test in Figma - how does it behave?
2. Test in Miro - same behavior?
3. Test in Excalidraw - any differences?
4. Document the pattern
5. Implement consistently
```

#### 5. Code Review Checklist

**When reviewing interaction PRs:**

```
‚ñ° Are there state guards in event handlers?
‚ñ° Is isDraggingShape checked where needed?
‚ñ° Is isMarqueeActive checked where needed?
‚ñ° Are all selection changes guarded?
‚ñ° Is fast interaction tested?
‚ñ° Does it match Figma behavior?
```

## Architecture Insights

### State Hierarchy

In canvas applications, state has a hierarchy of priority:

```
HIGHEST PRIORITY (Block other operations):
1. isDraggingShape    - User is actively dragging
2. isDrawing          - User is creating a shape
3. isEditingText      - User is editing text
4. isMarqueeActive    - User is box-selecting

LOWER PRIORITY (Can be interrupted):
5. hasSelection       - Shapes are selected
6. mode (pan/move/draw) - Current tool mode
```

**Rule**: Higher priority states should block lower priority state changes.

### Event Guard Pattern

```javascript
// GOOD: Explicit state checks
function handleInteraction() {
  // Check high-priority states first
  if (isDraggingShape) return;
  if (isDrawing) return;
  if (isMarqueeActive) return;
  
  // Proceed with lower-priority operation
  handleSelectionChange();
}

// BAD: No guards
function handleInteraction() {
  // ‚ùå Immediately changes state
  handleSelectionChange();
}
```

### Why Figma Uses This Pattern

**From Figma's Design:**

1. **Predictable Behavior**: Users know their current action won't be interrupted
2. **No Accidental Changes**: Fast movements don't cause unintended state changes
3. **Professional Feel**: App feels stable and responsive
4. **Reduced Bugs**: Fewer edge cases to handle

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Lock current operation until completion
- Block all state changes that would interfere
- Only unlock when user explicitly completes or cancels
