## Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Problems:

1. **API Key Missing**
   - Symptom: "OpenAI API key not configured" error
   - Fix: Check `.env.local` has `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **AI Service Not Found**
   - Symptom: Import error for `aiService`
   - Fix: Verify `src/services/ai.js` exists from PR #18

3. **Firestore Permission Error**
   - Symptom: Shapes don't save, permission denied
   - Fix: Check Firestore rules, ensure user is authenticated

4. **Keyboard Shortcut Conflicts**
   - Symptom: Browser action fires instead of chat opening
   - Fix: May need to adjust shortcuts

5. **Panel Hidden Behind Canvas**
   - Symptom: Can't see chat panel
   - Fix: Check z-index (should be 20)
